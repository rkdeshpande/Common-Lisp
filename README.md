# Common-Lisp-Projects

This repository contains Common Lisp projects I did for fun.  The purpose was to use a language that I had no experience with, to improve my skills as a programmer.  Many of the projects here are derived from the book Practical Common Lisp, and are not my own creation.  The inspiration, technique, structure, etc. are from this book and belong to the author.  Any such projects are denoted with the prefix "PCL-".
